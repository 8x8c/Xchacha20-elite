<h1>mysecureapp-xchacha</h1>
<p>
    <strong>mysecureapp-xchacha</strong> is a minimal command-line tool 
    written in Rust to provide <em>password-based file encryption</em> 
    in-place using <strong>XChaCha20-Poly1305</strong> and 
    <strong>Argon2id</strong>. It automatically detects whether a file 
    is already encrypted (via a magic header) and either encrypts or 
    decrypts it without requiring additional flags.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
    This tool offers in-place encryption using:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Argon2id</strong> for key derivation from a user-supplied password 
        and a random salt. Argon2id is a memory-hard function, 
        making brute-forcing more difficult on modern hardware.</li>
    <li><strong>XChaCha20-Poly1305</strong>, a modern AEAD (Authenticated Encryption 
        with Associated Data) cipher that provides confidentiality and data integrity. 
        It uses a 24-byte nonce (XNonce), which reduces the risk of nonce collisions 
        and allows safe random nonce generation without tracking usage counters.</li>
    <li><strong>Atomic overwrite</strong> of files via a temporary file rename approach, 
        reducing the risk of data corruption.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Rust (latest stable recommended), or a sufficiently recent version to support 
        the required crates.</li>
    <li>The following crates from <code>crates.io</code>:
        <code>chacha20poly1305</code>, <code>argon2</code>, <code>rand</code>, 
        <code>zeroize</code>, <code>anyhow</code>, <code>clap</code>, 
        <code>rpassword</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Building</h2>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code># Clone or copy the project
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mysecureapp-xchacha.git
cd mysecureapp-xchacha

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# The compiled binary will be in target/release/mysecureapp-xchacha
ls target/release/mysecureapp-xchacha
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
    You can move or copy <code>mysecureapp-xchacha</code> to a directory 
    in your <code>PATH</code> to run it more conveniently.
</p>

<h2>4. Usage</h2>
<p>
    <strong>mysecureapp-xchacha</strong> takes exactly 
    <strong>one argument</strong> (the file path). Depending on whether 
    that file is detected as already encrypted or not, the tool 
    either encrypts or decrypts in-place.
</p>

<div class="code-block">
<pre><code>Usage:
  ./mysecureapp-xchacha &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>4.1. Encrypting</h3>
<p>
    If the file is not recognized as encrypted (i.e. it does not start with 
    the magic header <code>MYXCHAPP</code>), the app will encrypt it:
</p>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code>./mysecureapp-xchacha secrets.txt
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
    You will be prompted to enter a password twice (to confirm). The file 
    is then overwritten with a random salt, a 24-byte XChaCha nonce, and 
    the XChaCha20-Poly1305 ciphertext. It also stores the magic header at 
    the start, so it can recognize it next time.
</p>

<h3>4.2. Decrypting</h3>
<p>
    If the file <em>does</em> start with the magic header <code>MYXCHAPP</code> 
    (meaning it was previously encrypted by this tool), 
    <strong>mysecureapp-xchacha</strong> will decrypt in place.
</p>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code>./mysecureapp-xchacha secrets.txt
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
    This time you only need to enter the password once. The file is then 
    overwritten with the original plaintext if the password is correct 
    and integrity checks pass.
</p>

<h2>5. Security Considerations</h2>
<p>
    Since this tool is entirely <em>password-based</em>, overall security 
    depends on your password strength. Argon2id slows down brute-force attempts, 
    but cannot compensate for <em>very weak</em> passwords.
</p>

<h3>5.1 Recommended Password Length</h3>
<p>
    Aim for <strong>12-16 characters minimum</strong>. For more robust security, 
    consider <strong>20+</strong> characters. Good strategies include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Random strings from a password manager (e.g. <code>%Qf8_ki!P&</code>).</li>
    <li>A short passphrase of multiple random words (e.g. <code>rusty-wyvern-integer-egg</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
    A short or dictionary-based password can still be brute-forced offline 
    if an attacker obtains your encrypted file.
</p>

<div class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> XChaCha20-Poly1305 is <em>excellent</em> at providing 
    confidentiality and data integrity, but it <em>cannot</em> protect you if 
    your password is easily guessed. Always pick a high-entropy password!
</div>

<h3>5.2 Memory-Hard Argon2id</h3>
<p>
    The code uses Argon2id with <strong>64 MB</strong> memory, <strong>3 iterations</strong>, 
    and <strong>4 lanes</strong> for parallelism. This can be tweaked for your 
    hardware. More memory and iterations mean stronger resistance to brute-forcing 
    but require more time/RAM during encryption/decryption.
</p>

<h2>6. Internals</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Magic Header:</strong> <code>MYXCHAPP</code> (8 bytes) prepended 
        to encrypted files. If present, we assume it's already encrypted.</li>
    <li><strong>Salt (16 bytes):</strong> Generated randomly each time a file 
        is encrypted, stored just after the magic header.</li>
    <li><strong>XChaCha Nonce (24 bytes):</strong> Placed after the salt. 
        This ensures each encryption run is unique and helps avoid nonce reuse.</li>
    <li><strong>Ciphertext:</strong> The result of <code>XChaCha20Poly1305</code> 
        encryption, including the Poly1305 authentication tag for tamper detection.</li>
    <li><strong>Zeroization:</strong> The tool uses <code>zeroize</code> to wipe 
        the derived key, salt, nonce, and password from memory after each operation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Example Workflow</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Plaintext file: <code>notes.txt</code></li>
            <li>Run <code>./mysecureapp-xchacha notes.txt</code></li>
            <li>Enter a strong password twice; the file is overwritten with 
                <code>[MYXCHAPP | salt(16) | nonce(24) | ciphertext]</code>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Decryption:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The file starts with <code>MYXCHAPP</code>.</li>
            <li>Run <code>./mysecureapp-xchacha notes.txt</code> again.</li>
            <li>Enter the same password once; if correct, the file is overwritten 
                with the recovered plaintext.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>8. Atomic Overwrite</h2>
<p>
    The app writes to a temporary file (e.g. <code>notes.txt.tmp</code>) and 
    then renames it over the original, ensuring if anything fails, the original 
    file is not corrupted mid-encryption/decryption.
</p>

<h2>9. Limitations</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Large files:</strong> The entire file is read into memory. 
        For gigabyte-scale data, consider a streaming or chunk-based approach.</li>
    <li><strong>Single user/password:</strong> No multi-recipient capability 
        is included. This is purely a <em>single password → single file</em> model.</li>
    <li><strong>No hardware acceleration usage explicitly:</strong> 
        <code>xchacha20poly1305</code> uses pure Rust or subtle CPU intrinsics 
        if available. Performance is typically very good, but not as hardware-accelerated 
        as some AES instructions on modern CPUs.</li>
</ul>
